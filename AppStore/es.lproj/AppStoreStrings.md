Onion Browser is the original free and open-source Tor-powered web browser for iOS. Onion Browser helps you access the internet with more safety and privacy, and no extra cost to you.

“The best Tor-related offering on iOS right now is Onion Browser” - The Daily Dot, October 14, 2015.

Destacado en: The New York Times, The Guardian, Salon, TechCrunch, Gizmodo, Boing Boing, Lifehacker, Macworld, The Daily Dot, y otros.

CARACTERÍSTICAS:
• Navega por Internet a través de Tor:
- Protect your privacy from website tracking.
- Secure your traffic from insecure wireless networks and ISPs.
- Support for HTTPS Everywhere, an automatic switch to HTTPS enabled websites.
- Accede a sitios .onion que sólo son accesibles a través de Tor.

• Fight online tracking: block scripts and automatically clear cookies and tabs, based on your preferences.

• ¡Y más características de mejora de la privacidad!

DISCLAIMERS:
- Web browsing is much slower than through a normal web browser or a VPN because your traffic is encrypted and relayed through the Tor network.

- El contenido multimedia a menudo elude Tor y compromete su privacidad; los ficheros y streams de vídeo están bloqueados por defecto y no están soportados por el Navegador Onion.

- Onion Browser might not work on networks with advanced network restrictions. If the app does not connect, try using bridges (or a different type of bridge), force-quit, and then restart the app.

- El uso del Navegador Onion es por su cuenta y riesgo, recuerde que los datos sensibles no siempre tienen su origen en un dispositivo móvil.
