Welcome to Onion Browser 2!

Onion Browser 2 is a total rewrite of the app which contains several new features:

* A friendlier first-time launch experience
* An updated user interface, containing "tabbed browsing" and improved settings panels
* HTTPS Everywhere support
* 1Password support
* Built-in ad-blocking and privacy protection
* Tweak security/privacy settings on a per-site basis (including cookie policy, user agent, and JavaScript/active content policy)
* Tor 0.3.1.9
* Settings and bookmarks from Onion Browser 1 are retained, with the exception of the user-agent spoofing string

Best of all: this update is free!

The Onion Browser 2 update was supported by the Guardian Project, with help from Benjamin Erhart and Carrie Winfrey. Onion Browser 2 is based on the open-source "Endless" Browser; special thanks to Joshua Stein for creating Endless and for granting permission to use it in Onion Browser. See the credits file in the app settings for more information.

“The best Tor-related offering on iOS right now is Onion Browser” - The Daily Dot, October 14, 2015.

Featured in: The New York Times, The Guardian, Salon, TechCrunch, Gizmodo, Boing Boing, Lifehacker, Macworld, The Daily Dot, & others.

FEATURES:
• Browse the internet over Tor:
- Websites do not see your real IP address.
- ISPs and insecure wireless networks cannot track your browsing.
- Access .onion sites that are only accessible over Tor.

• Defeat internet filters and censors with "obfs4" & "meek" traffic masking.

• Fight online tracking: use a new IP address and clear your cookies/history/cache in one button.

• And more privacy-enhancing features!

DISCLAIMERS:
Web browsing is much slower than through a normal web browser or a VPN because your traffic is encrypted and relayed through the Tor network.

Multimedia often bypass Tor and compromise your privacy; video files and video streams are blocked by default and are not supported by Onion Browser.

Onion Browser might not work when inside countries or using ISPs that actively block Tor. If the app does not connect, try using bridges or visit the Help/Support page to see what you can do. Onion Browser does not carry any guarantee of successful use.

Use of Onion Browser is at your own risk; remember that sensitive data does not always belong on a mobile device.

Onion Browser is free and open-source software. You can read more about Onion Browser and how to support development of Tor on iOS by visiting onionbrowser.com
