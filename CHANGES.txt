Onion Browser Version History (since 1.2.2)

===== 1.3.1 - Waiting For Review =====
Sep 12, 2012 - Build/submit date
         TBD - App Store accept date

* Support iPhone 5 (taller 4" Retina screen). Also compile openssl,
  libevent, and Tor for "armv7s" CPU target, which represents the new
  A6 processor. May improve performance on the iPhone 5 versus
  more generically compiled versions of those libraries.

* Fix dumb issue where iOS 5.0 devices were not supported. Onion Browser
  should work in all devices that have iOS 5.0 or higher. (Please go to
  http://onionbrowser.com/help/ and contact me if you are on an iOS 5.0
  device and have issues.)

* Fix tapping on text box in "bridge edit" view.

* Update tor to 0.2.3.21-rc (Sep 05, 2012).

* Note: 1.3.0 was not released. This version contains and supersedes
  all changes in that version -- read below for details.

===== 1.3.0 - (Bumped for 1.3.1) =====
(App Store submission was canceled so 1.3.1 could be released)

* Bookmarking ability. Moved most of the "quick links" from startup
  page into default bookmarks.

* Major changes to underlying Tor wrapper code. May solve issues
  related to connection dying after the app has been open for some
  time and if the app was open while the device went into idle sleep.
  (Issue #2, Issue #3)

* Fixes CSS/JS on sites like meine-startseite.de, where statically gzipped
  resources are served (i.e. "foo.gz.css") automatically. HTTP code in
  Onion Browser now automatically handles these cases. (Issue #21)

* Ability to configure Tor bridges. This is primarily geared toward advanced
  users that are using networks that block Tor based on known Tor nodes.
  See http://onionbrowser.com/help/ for instructions.

* Update tor to 0.2.3.21-rc (Sep 05, 2012).

===== 1.2.6 - In App Store =====
Sep 05, 2012 - Build/submit date
Sep 11, 2012 - App Store accept date

* Add warning message when clicking "New Identity" because of possible
  history leak: ":visited" CSS style still triggers on visited URLs
  despite clearing UIWebView history. (Issue #20 reported by sintime.)

* Closing the app while doing "initial connection" no longer causes
  connection to hang. App properly cancels connections/exits so that
  initialization retries properly on next app open.

* HTTP Pipelining can now be disabled. Can fix issues with some
  websites. (Based on issue reported by Jose C. M.)

* User-Agent spoof strings updated to Windows 7 Firefox 10 (matching
  TorButton) and Safari 6 Mountain Lion.

* Updated libevent to 2.0.20-stable (Aug 23, 2012)
