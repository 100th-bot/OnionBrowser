Onion Browser Version History (since 1.2.2)

===== 1.4.2 - In Development =====
Onion Browser is currently receiving a security audit by Cure53.de,
funded by the Open Technology Fund (Radio Free Asia). Security issues
corrected due to this audit are marked with the vulnerability ID
(i.e. "OB-01-XX").

* OB-01-005: "Third-Party Cookie" blocking was not working as
  expected. The "Block Third Party" cookie option simply allowed all
  cookies. Fixed in e70e2fcbca. See
  https://mike.tig.as/onionbrowser/security/ for more details.

* OB-01-006: Due to improper handling of itms: and itms-app: URIs, an
  attacker could cause the iTunes app to auto-open from Onion Browser,
  causing iTunes to open too quickly for the Tor tunnel would close
  properly. If Onion Browser was in the middle of loading resources
  from the attacker's page, partial SSL traffic would be sent to the
  attacker's website outside of Tor, exposing the user's real IP
  address. Fixed in 89121d3271.

* OB-01-009: Domain names containing ".onion" anywhere originally
  bypassed all SSL certificate checks. Fixed in 271b2b22df.

* OB-01-010: WebSockets were discovered to bypass Tor entirely and no
  easy avenue for intercepting these requests (to pass into Tor or to
  block) has been discovered yet. Active Content Blocking now blocks
  these connections by default; unfortunately, this also blocks all
  AJAX/XHR requests as well. A (dangerous) option to re-enable all
  Javascript-based requests has been added. Fixed in 983687ed67.

* OB-01-013: The "click here to force-quit the app" function inside
  the help page has been replaced with instructions on how to quit
  the app manually. The "onionbrowser:forcequit" URL was previously
  susceptible to an app-crasher attack (i.e. by inclusion in a tag
  such as <img src="onionbrowser:forcequit">) and has been removed.
  Fixed in c5cfb15a99.

* OB-01-016: HTML content loaded via "data:" URIs would bypass the
  "Block Active Content" setting. If a user navigates to a specially
  crafted "data:text/html..." URI (via redirect or "meta refresh"),
  the page could load a video tag, exposing the user's IP address.
  "data:" URIs that are not image files are now blocked from being
  loaded in the address bar or via redirect. Fixed in 546a5434b1.

* OB-01-017: Onion Browser previously loaded "onionbrowser://" URLs
  without prompting the user. This could create a case where an
  attack site opened in another browser would redirect a user to
  "onionbrowser://example.com/?ip=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx", revealing at the
  user at the given IP address is an Onion Browser user and then
  identify the Onion Browser session to that particular user. Onion
  Browser now prompts a user on incoming links, displaying the link
  before the browser proceeds. Fixed fixed in d7d1941d3d.

* User-agent strings have been updated. "Windows" spoof updated to
  Windows 7 Firefox 24.0, same as Tor Browser Bundle. "Mac Safari"
  updated to OS X 10.9.2 Safari 7.0.3, most up-to-date version.

===== 1.4.1 - In App Store =====
Apr 21 2014 - Submit Date
Apr 23 2014 - App store availability

* OpenSSL updated to 1.0.1g, fixing the Heartbleed bug. Note that in
  Onion Browser, Heartbleed only affects the connection between your
  the device and a Tor entry guard or bridge. Browser traffic is not
  vulnerable (but speaking to affected websites is still insecure
  regardless of which browser you use).

* Tor updated to 0.2.4.21.

* Compiled for iOS SDK 7.1 (XCode 5.1).

* Onion Browser now encrypts locally-stored data, including browser
  settings, bookmarks, and Tor bridges (if enabled).

* Fix issue where Onion Browser was not allowing third-party apps to
  open. When encountering a URI scheme that can open in another app,
  Onion Browser will now ask the user if they want to open the app.
  (Example: clicking on a "tel:" link can now open the phone app
  rather than simply fail.)

* Tweaks to content-security-policy so that even with "active content
  blocking" enabled, some safe activity is still allowed, such as
  using the target attribute on a link inside a frame. Fixes issues
  with websites using frames (including default home page). Contributed
  by Łukasz Pilorz.


PREVIOUS VERSIONS:

===== 1.4 =====
Feb 01 2014 - Submit Date
Feb 05 2014 - App store availability

* App is now being compiled with 64-bit CPU optimization (for iPhone 5S
  and new iPads), which may improve cryptographic performance and battery
  life. (Older devices are still supported, as long as they are using a
  compatible version of iOS.)

  COMPATIBILITY NOTE: App now requires iOS 6.0 or greater.

* A progress bar / loading bar, similar to one used in Safari, has been
  added to the app. Uses NJKWebViewProgress, by Satoshi Asano.
  https://github.com/ninjinkun/NJKWebViewProgress

* A copy of the help site has been embedded into the app, for offline
  viewing. This should help users having trouble when encountering the
  "Tor stops working after idle" bug.

* Fix awkward navbar / address bar spacing in iOS 7.


===== 1.3.14  =====
Jan 26 2014 - Submit date
Jan 30 2014 - App store availability

* MAJOR SECURITY IMPROVEMENT: Add experimental ability to turn off
  JavaScript and other active content. See onionbrowser.com for more
  details. Patch based on contribution by Łukasz Pilorz.

  (COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Active content blocking is only partially supported
  in iOS 5.1. Users are advised to upgrade their devices to a newer version
  of iOS.)

* Ability to set a custom home page. Revamped settings so that future
  customizations will be easier to implement.

* Add ability for other apps to open links in Onion Browser. Other apps
  can use the "onionbrowser://" (HTTP) or "onionbrowsers://" (HTTPS) URI
  protocols to launch Onion Browser. See README.

* Tweak "Connecting..." info page, based on input from Wong Choon Jie.

* Update default home page.

* OpenSSL updated to 1.0.1f.

* Tor updated to 0.2.4.20.


===== 1.3.13  =====
Nov 17, 2013 - Submit date
Nov 20, 2013 - App store availability

* More fixes to iPad "black bar" issue on iOS 7.0.

* Tor updated to 0.2.4.18-rc, which enables TLS 1.1 and 1.2 for improved
  security.


===== 1.3.12  =====
Oct 18, 2013 - Submit date
Oct 23, 2013 - App store availability

* Fix issue when opening app on iPad when in Landscape mode. ("Black bar"
  problem.)

* Fix some possible instances of random crashing introduced in previous
  version.

* Fix issue where bottom of webpage was covered by toolbar at bottom of
  screen.


===== (No version 1.3.11) =====


===== 1.3.10  =====
Oct 11, 2013 - Submit date
Oct 16, 2013 - App store availability

* MAJOR PRIVACY ISSUE FIXED: App previously did not successfully wipe
  HTML5 "application storage" (aka "local storage" or "app cache"), even
  when force-quitting or selecting "New Identity". This could be seen by
  testing a Google Search and noticing previous searches in a dropdown
  (due to Google's use of this cache). (Issue 26)
  https://github.com/mtigas/iOS-OnionBrowser/commit/dffce7070856927a8bb9f92a8fa67523d0e9eb10
  https://github.com/mtigas/iOS-OnionBrowser/commit/7ae6bcb5aa33538159c423a3b6c9987725e46d9a

* Add check.torproject.org frame to homepage, to ensure that user has
  successfully connected to Tor. (See Issue 28)
  https://github.com/mtigas/iOS-OnionBrowser/commit/18590148ee9e527c07dc82cb85143bc085f29c1e

* Fix issue with "New Identity" button on iPad when device is rotated
  in landscape mode. (Issue 32)
  https://github.com/mtigas/iOS-OnionBrowser/commit/df1c98b96e05db6e1c2f86125396e10cb8bb48a6

* Force using "ntor" connection handshake, which is faster and is now
  the default for 0.2.4.X and newer versions of Tor. This is preferred
  by 0.2.4.X relays (and is forced on in 0.2.5.X). This is a countermeasure
  against the botnet congestion that was introduced in September 2013
  and helps reduce load on the overall Tor network.

===== 1.3.9 =====
Oct 06, 2013 - Submit date
Oct 10, 2013 - App store availability

* Quick fix to support iOS 5.1+. Previous update accidentally required
  iOS 7.0.

* OPTIMIZATION NOTE: iPhone 5s (64-bit) CPU optimization -- introduced in
  the previous version -- has been removed. Apps compiled with these CPU
  optimziations are only compatible with iOS 6.0 and greater.

  This only affects minor portions of the encryption/decryption code. Much
  of the CPU load related to Onion Browser is caused by browser rendering,
  rather than encryption, so the speedups were negligible in the first place.

  When compiling your own copy of Onion Browser from this source tree, you
  can re-enable the CPU optimizations by going to [OnionBrowser project ->
  Build Settings -> Architectures] and then selecting "Standard architectures
  (including 64-bit)". This will require you to change Deployment Target
  to 6.0 or greater.

===== 1.3.8 =====

* COMPATIBILITY NOTE: An issue with the way this release was processed
  causes it to require iOS 7.0. An update has been submitted that will return
  support for iOS versions earlier than 7.0.

* Native iOS 7 support and iPhone 5s (64-bit) performance optimizations.

* Tor updated to 0.2.4.17-rc.

===== 1.3.7 =====
Jun 29, 2013 - Submit date
Jul 03, 2013 - App store availability

* COMPATIBILITY NOTE: App now requires iOS 5.1 and greater. This change should
  only affect an extreme minority of users who remain on iOS 5.0.

* Add links to StartPage/IxQuick and DuckDuckGo (non-onion) since the DDG
  .onion service occasionally has issues. (Based on user-reported issue.)

* Update user-agent spoof to match latest Tor Browser Bundle (for "Windows 7"
  spoof) and Mac OS X Safari (for "OS X" spoof). (Based on user-reported
  issue.)

* Fix minor code typo (thanks to user-submitted patch).

* Update Reachability library to allow ARC for increased stability.

* Update tor to 0.2.4.14-alpha (Jun 18, 2013) [1]

===== 1.3.6 =====
Jun 18, 2013 - Submit date
Jun 21, 2013 - App store availability

* Fixes support for streamed HTTP requests. This fixes "long" requests, such
  as uploading images or other media, i.e. on Twitter. (Issue #29; fix
  contributed by brantyoung)

* Update tor to 0.2.4.13-alpha (Jun 14, 2013). Provides important fix to
  crash-related vulnerability, and other security updates and minor fixes.[1]

===== 1.3.5 =====
May 18, 2013 - Submit date
May 22, 2013 - App store availability

* Update tor to 0.2.4.12-alpha (Apr 18, 2013). Provides several security
  updates and minor fixes.[1]

===== 1.3.4 - In App Store =====
Mar 17, 2013 - Build/submit date
Mar 21, 2013 - App store availability

* Update tor to 0.2.4.11-alpha (Mar 11, 2013). Moved back to alpha
  releases since 0.2.4.X introduces several security & performance
  improvements. Also eases future investigation of integrating obfs2 or
  other pluggable transports in the future. (This would allow Onion Browser
  to operate in areas where Tor is blocked due to deep packet
  inspection techniques.)

  The new "ntor" circuit-building handshake protocol[1] (with improved
  security and performance) is compiled into this version but will not
  be used until it Tor directory servers recommend[2] it.

  [2]: http://archives.seul.org/tor/cvs/Jan-2013/msg00121.html

* Update openssl to 1.0.1e (Feb 11 2013).

  Changes 1.0.1c -> 1.0.1d: https://www.openssl.org/news/news.html
  Changes 1.0.1d -> 1.0.1e: https://www.openssl.org/news/announce.html

* Update compile settings to build against iOS SDK 6.1. App remains
  compatible for devices running iOS 5.0+.

===== 1.3.3 =====
Dec 07, 2012 - Build date
Dec 13, 2012 - App Store accept date

* Update tor to 0.2.3.25 (Nov 19, 2012). This is a stable release.

* Update libevent to 2.0.21-stable (Nov 18, 2012)


===== 1.3.2 =====
Nov 04, 2012 - Build/submit date
Nov 12, 2012 - App Store accept date

* Update tor to 0.2.3.24-rc (Oct 25, 2012). Fixes several security
  and connectivity-related issues.


===== 1.3.1 =====
Sep 12, 2012 - Build/submit date
Sep 18, 2012 - App Store accept date

* Support iPhone 5 (taller 4" Retina screen). Also compile openssl,
  libevent, and Tor for "armv7s" CPU target, which represents the new
  A6 processor. May improve performance on the iPhone 5 versus
  more generically compiled versions of those libraries.

* Bookmarking feature. Moved most of the "quick links" from startup
  page into "preset" bookmarks.

* Ability to configure Tor bridges. This is primarily geared toward
  advanced users that are using networks that attempt to block Tor via
  a "master list" of Tor nodes. See http://onionbrowser.com/help/
  for instructions.

* Major changes to underlying Tor wrapper code. May solve issues
  related to connection dying after the app has been open for some
  time and if the app was open while the device went into idle sleep.
  (Issue #2, Issue #3)

* Fixes CSS/JS on sites like meine-startseite.de, where statically gzipped
  resources are served (i.e. "foo.gz.css") automatically. HTTP code in
  Onion Browser now automatically handles these cases. (Issue #21)

* Fix issue where devices running iOS 5.1+ would work. Onion Browser
  should now work properly in all devices that have iOS 5.0 or higher.

* Update tor to 0.2.3.22-rc (Sep 11, 2012).


===== 1.3.0 =====
* Note: 1.3.0 was not released due to a bug discovered after original
  submission. 1.3.1 (above) contains and supersedes all changes that were
  originally slatedfor that version. All changes since 1.2.6 are listed above.


===== 1.2.6 =====
Sep 05, 2012 - Build/submit date
Sep 11, 2012 - App Store accept date

* Add warning message when clicking "New Identity" because of possible
  history leak: ":visited" CSS style still triggers on visited URLs
  despite clearing UIWebView history. (Issue #20 reported by sintime.)

* Closing the app while doing "initial connection" no longer causes
  connection to hang. App properly cancels connections/exits so that
  initialization retries properly on next app open.

* HTTP Pipelining can now be disabled. Can fix issues with some
  websites. (Based on issue reported by Jose C. M.)

* User-Agent spoof strings updated to Windows 7 Firefox 10 (matching
  TorButton) and Safari 6 Mountain Lion.

* Updated libevent to 2.0.20-stable (Aug 23, 2012)


===== 1.2.5 =====
Aug 23, 2012 - Build/submit date
Aug 30, 2012 - App Store accept date

* Fix rare IP address leak demonstrated on "ip-check.info": web pages
  with resources defined in non-HTTP/HTTPS URLs (i.e. "ftp://...")
  would leak IP address. (Hat-tip to Graham R.)

* Update tor to 0.2.3.20-rc (Aug 05, 2012).


===== 1.2.4 =====
Jul 20, 2012 - Build/submit date
