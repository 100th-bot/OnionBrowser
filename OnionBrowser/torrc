# Until ERN process is complete, mainline version of this app is only for sale
# in US & CA. Optimize performance (since latency is already high on mobile and
# user tolerance is not) until some point in the future when we can determine
# the performance penalty of allowing EntryNodes from everywhere. NOTE tor can
# still connect to EntryNodes that do not match this if it wants to, but it
# will strongly prefer US/CA.
