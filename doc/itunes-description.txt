“A Mobile Browser For The Truly Paranoid” - TechCrunch

”Attention dissidents, free-thinkers or just people who are plain on the run: now you can take your iPad with you and not get caught.” - Cult of Mac

“…if you're going to be your freaky online-self on your phone, at least cover your tracks.” - Gizmodo

--------------------

• Internet access tunneled over the Tor onion router network:
- Websites do not see your real IP address.
- Your connection is encrypted before it leaves your device, providing protection against snooping by ISPs or people who share a WiFi connection with you.
- Tunnel bypasses restrictive firewalls: you can access the entire Internet from behind ISPs or corporate connections, or when inside countries that practice online censorship.
- Access websites on the "dark net" of anonymous .onion web sites, only accessible in the Tor network.

• User-Agent spoofing option can the fact that you are using an iPhone/iPad from websites you visit.

• Ability to block third party cookies or all cookies.

• Can change IP address and clear cookies/history/cache in one button.

PERFORMANCE NOTE: web browsing through the anonymization network will be SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWER than through a non-tunneled browser.

CHINA/IRAN NOTE: Due to online censorship techniques using deep-packet inspection (DPI), this app does NOT currently function in China or Iran.
